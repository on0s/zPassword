# ADR-0001: Cryptography Choices

## Context
zPassword requires modern, secure cryptography for key derivation, encryption, and one-time passwords.

## Decision
- **Key derivation:** Argon2id with configurable memory, time, and parallelism.
- **Authenticated encryption:** XChaCha20-Poly1305 for nonce-misuse resistance.
- **TOTP:** RFC 6238 using HMAC-SHA1 producing 6-digit codes.

## Status
Accepted.

## Consequences
Using industry-standard primitives simplifies auditing and provides cross-platform support.
